# wordle
Console-based; Still in the works

Makes the user guess the number word from a list of number words (not the final list product)

Some attributes of the program:
● Letters that are present in the word and are in the correct location will be revealed as the
specific letters.
● Letters that are present in the word but in the incorrect location will be scored with a
vertical bar |.
● Letters that are absent will be scored with an underline.
● With each guess score, there will be a list of unused letters

In the works:
● Only real words will be considered legitimate inputs
● Only words with the proper length will be considered legitimate inputs
● If the user re-uses a letter, the user will be reminded that the letter had already been
used
